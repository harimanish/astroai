# Vector and Semantic Databases
- ![An Evaluation of Vector Database Systems: Features, and Use Cases | by  Raghav Yadav | Dev Genius](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*98Vn2qeGSyjFWB4d.png)
- ## What are Vector Databases?
  
  * Store data as high-dimensional vectors (embeddings).
  * Embeddings capture the *semantic meaning* of data.
  * Enable similarity search based on *context*.
  * Ideal for AI applications:
    * Semantic search
    * Recommendation systems
    * Image/video retrieval
    * Chatbots/question answering

- ## ebeddings
  
  * **Embeddings:** Numerical representations of data (text, images, etc.).
  * Similar data points have *close* vectors.
  * Vector databases use algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity) to find nearest neighbors.
  * This allows for fast and accurate semantic search.
- ## Usage
  
  * **High-Dimensional Indexing:** Efficiently searching through millions of vectors.
  * **Similarity Search Algorithms:** Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.
  * **Scalability:** Handling massive datasets and high query volumes.
  * **Integration:** Seamlessly working with AI frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
  * **Metadata Filtering:** Combining semantic search with traditional filtering.
- ## AI Applications
  
  * **Semantic Search:** Finding relevant information based on meaning.
  * **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting similar products or content.
  * **Image/Video Retrieval:** Searching for visually similar media.
  * **Chatbots:** Providing contextually relevant responses.
  * **Fraud Detection:** Identifying anomalous patterns in financial data.
- ## Vector DB
  
  * Pinecone
  * Weaviate
  * Milvus
  * FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
  * Chroma
  * Qdrant
- ## Why Use Vector Databases?
  
  * Improved search accuracy.
  * Enhanced AI performance.
  * Faster data retrieval.
  * More intuitive user experiences.
  * Enablement of new AI applications.
