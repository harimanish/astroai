# Hardware Essentials for AI Development
- /h2 CUDA Cores: Versatile Parallel Calculators
- These cores are the foundation of general-purpose parallel processing within NVIDIA GPUs.
- They function as highly efficient binary calculators, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication.
- A single CUDA core can perform one multiply and one add operation per clock cycle.
- A dedicated section of  transistors within each CUDA core handles the "fused multiply-add" (FMA) operation (A * B + C), which is a fundamental and frequently used operation, especially in graphics and also many AI calculations.
- While they are most commonly used in video game graphics, they are also used in many AI calculations.
- ## Tensor Cores: Matrix Multiplication Powerhouses
- These specialized cores are designed to accelerate matrix operations, which are the core of deep learning.
- Tensor cores excel at performing matrix multiplication and addition.
- They can efficiently compute the operation A * B + C, where A, B, and C are matrices.
- Because all input matrix values are available simultaneously, Tensor cores perform these calculations concurrently, significantly speeding up processing.
- They are the key to high speed neural network processing.
- ## Ray Tracing Cores: Specialized for Graphics (not ai related skip)
- These cores are specifically designed to perform ray tracing calculations, which are used to generate realistic lighting and shadows in computer graphics.
- While these are very important for graphical applications, they are not a core part of the hardware needed for AI development.
  They are the largest and fewest in number.
- ## Impact on AI Development:
- CUDA Cores: Provide the foundational parallel processing power for general AI tasks and data preprocessing.
- Tensor Cores: Dramatically accelerate deep learning training and inference by efficiently handling matrix operations.
- The combination of both core types allows modern GPUs to be incredibly powerful tools for AI development.
